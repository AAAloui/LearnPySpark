    "# Homework 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we are going to play with Twitter data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is represented as rows of of [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Example) strings.\n",
    "It consists of [tweets](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets), [messages](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/messages-types), and a small amount of broken data (cannot be parsed as JSON).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework, we will only focus on tweets and ignore all other messages.\n",

    "A tweet consists of many data fields. [Here is an example](https://gist.github.com/arapat/03d02c9b327e6ff3f6c3c5c602eeaf8b). You can learn all about them in the Twitter API doc. We are going to briefly introduce only the data fields that will be used in this homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `created_at`: Posted time of this tweet (time zone is included)\n",
    "* `id_str`: Tweet ID - we recommend using `id_str` over using `id` as Tweet IDs, becauase `id` is an integer and may bring some overflow problems.\n",
    "* `text`: Tweet content\n",
    "* `user`: A JSON object for information about the author of the tweet\n",
    "    * `id_str`: User ID\n",
    "    * `name`: User name (may contain spaces)\n",
    "    * `screen_name`: User screen name (no spaces)\n",
    "* `retweeted_status`: A JSON object for information about the retweeted tweet (i.e. this tweet is not original but retweeteed some other tweet)\n",
    "    * All data fields of a tweet except `retweeted_status`\n",
    "* `entities`: A JSON object for all entities in this tweet\n",
    "    * `hashtags`: An array for all the hashtags that are mentioned in this tweet\n",
    "    * `urls`: An array for all the URLs that are mentioned in this tweet\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data source\n",

    "Besides the original tweets, we will provide you with a Pickle file, which contains a partition over 452,743 Twitter users. It contains a Python dictionary `{user_id: partition_id}`. The users are partitioned into 7 groups."
